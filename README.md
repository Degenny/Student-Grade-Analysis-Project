This project was designed to explore ho Excel can be used not only for simple data entry but also for automating processes and generating meaningful isights. 
My goal was to build a small but complete grading system that could calculate scores, assign final grades and provide a clear picture of overall class performance.
The process began with creating a structured spreadsheet to record each student`s results, including quizzes, a midterm exam and a final exam. Once the data was in place, I used Excel formulas to transform raw numbers into actionable insights. The AVERAGE function allowed me to calculate the overall score for each student while a nested IF formula was implemented to automatically assign letter grades from A to F. This removed the need for manual grading and ensured consistency across the dataset.
To quicly identify the performance thresholds I introducea an additional formula to determine pass/fail status, with a score of 70 set as the pass mark. This simple automation provided an instant overview of who might require additional support.
Beyond individual results I also wanted to understand the class as a whole. For this I used a COUNTIF to calculate how many students fell into each grade category. With SUMIF I compared the total and the average scores of passing students versus failing students which highlighted a strong performance gap between the two groups.
One of the most interesting aspects of this project was adding automated recommendations. By creating a lookup table and combining it with VLOOKUP I built a system that generated personalized feedback for each student based on their final grade. 
This analysis showed a clear distribution of grades, mostly between A and C and highlighted the gap between passing and failing students. 

This project reflects my approach to data, start with structure, apply logical steps, and use the right tool to turn the raw numbers into clear insights.
